			A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its place
			in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently
			being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack
			and then starts carrying out the function.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the
			stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the stack takes up more space than it was assigned, a &#34;stack
			overflow&#34; error is thrown.
