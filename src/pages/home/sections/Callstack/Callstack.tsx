				<p>
					A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its
					place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is
					currently being run and what functions are called from within that
					function, etc.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call
						stack and then starts carrying out the function.
					</li>
					<li>
						Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call
						stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
					</li>
					<li>
						When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off
						the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code
						listing.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the stack takes up more space than it was assigned, a "stack
						overflow" error is thrown.
					</li>
				</ul>
