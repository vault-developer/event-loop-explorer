		<h2>Call stack</h2>
		<p>
			A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its place
			in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently
			being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call
				stack and then starts carrying out the function.
			</li>
			<li>
				Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call
				stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
			</li>
			<li>
				When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the
				stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
			</li>
			<li>
				If the stack takes up more space than it was assigned, a "stack
				overflow" error is thrown.
			</li>
		</ul>
