				A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its
				place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is
				currently being run and what functions are called from within that
				function, etc.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call
					stack and then starts carrying out the function.
				</li>
				<li>
					Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call
					stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
				</li>
				<li>
					When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off
					the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code
					listing.
				</li>
				<li>
					If the stack takes up more space than it was assigned, a "stack
					overflow" error is thrown.
				</li>
			</ul>
